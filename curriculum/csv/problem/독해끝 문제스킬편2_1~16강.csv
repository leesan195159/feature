Presentational styles have been subject to a tension between an informational-educational purpose and the need to engage us entertainingly. While current affairs programmes are often ‘serious’ in tone sticking to the ‘rules’ of balance, more popular programmes adopt a friendly, lighter, idiom in which we are invited to consider the impact of particular news items from the perspective of the ‘average person in the street’. Indeed, contemporary news construction has come to rely on an increased use of faster editing tempos and ‘flashier’ presentational styles including the use of logos, sound-bites, rapid visual cuts and the ‘star quality’ of news readers. Popular formats can be said to enhance understanding by engaging an audience unwilling to endure the longer verbal orientation of older news formats. However, they arguably work to reduce understanding by failing to provide the structural contexts for news events.",텔레비전 뉴스의 제작 스타일과 그 변화,뉴스의 교육적 목적의 정보 제공,대중적인 뉴스 형식과 오래된 뉴스 형식의 균형,현대 뉴스 형식의 한계,,,,

Many aspects of human culture have what archaeologists describe as low archaeological visibility, meaning they are difficult to identify archaeologically. Archaeologists tend to focus on tangible (or material) aspects of culture: things that can be handled and photographed, such as tools, food, and structures. Reconstructing intangible aspects of culture is more difficult, requiring that one draw more inferences from the tangible. It is relatively easy, for example, for archaeologists to identify and draw inferences about technology and diet from stone tools and food remains. Using the same kinds of physical remains to draw inferences about social systems and what people were thinking about is more difficult. Archaeologists do it, but there are necessarily more inferences involved in getting from physical remains recognized as trash to making interpretations about belief systems. <br><div style=""float: right;"">*archaeological: 고고학의</div>",insufficient,old-fashioned,verifiable,elaborate,,,,0,,1,1,다음 중 빈칸 문장을 읽은 다음의 독해 방향을 고르시오. ,"The growth of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines, such as art history or palaeontology, and of particular figures such as the art critic, helped produce principles and practices for selecting and organizing what was worthy of keeping, though it remained a struggle.

Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ― their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners and by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly telling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about nature and its relationship to urban society. Indeed, what distinguishes a park from the broader category of public space is the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody. ( ① ) Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, even indoor atriums. ( ② ) Parks typically have trees, grass, and other plants as their central features. ( ③ ) When entering a city park, people often imagine a sharp separation from streets, cars, and buildings. ( ④ ) What’s behind this idea is not only landscape architects’ desire to design aesthetically suggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western thought that envisions cities and nature as antithetical spaces and oppositional forces.<br><div style=""float: right;"">*aesthetically: 미적으로 **antithetical: 대조적인</div>",①,②,③,④,,,,0,,1,1,다음 중 ③뒤의 문장에 대한 내용으로 옳은 것을 고르시오.,"<div style=""border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;"">It may be easier to reach an agreement when settlement terms don’t have to be implemented until months in the future.</div><br>Negotiators should try to find ways to slice a large issue into smaller pieces, known as using salami tactics.

(①) This is why, to a person, the first great theorists of film decried the introduction of sound and other technical innovations (such as color) that pushed film in the direction of realism. (②) Since cinema was an entirely fantasmatic art, these innovations were completely unnecessary. (③) And what’s worse, they could do nothing but turn filmmakers and audiences away from the fantasmatic dimension of cinema, potentially transforming film into a mere delivery device for representations of reality. (④) But sound and color threatened to create just such an illusion, thereby destroying the very essence of film art. As Rudolf Arnheim puts it, “The creative power of the artist can only come into play where reality and the medium of representation do not coincide.” <br><div style=""float: right;"">*decry: 공공연히 비난하다 **fantasmatic: 환상의</div>",①,②,③,④,,,,

REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement, a stage of sleep discovered by Professor Nathaniel Kleitman at the University of Chicago in 1958. ( ① ) Along with a medical student, Eugene Aserinsky, he noted that when people are sleeping, they exhibit rapid eye movement, as if they were “looking” at something. ( ② ) Ongoing research by Kleitman and Aserinsky concluded that it was during this period of rapid eye movement that people dream, yet their minds are as active as someone who is awake. ( ③ ) Interestingly enough, studies have found that along with rapid eye movement, our heart rates increase and our respiration is also elevated ― yet our bodies do not move and are basically paralyzed due to a nerve center in the brain that keeps our bodies motionless besides some occasional twitches and jerks.
